# trinket-bootloader
a modified version of the trinket boot loader by Adadfruit https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-Trinket-Gemma-Bootloader
instead of waiting for the usb time out to excecute the already loaded code in to the attiny85, just put PB0 to gnd at power up to enter in to the bootloader.
